**Web Scraping Project: Top 50 Companies by Revenue**

In this project, I web scraped the list of the top 50 companies by revenue from Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_companies_by_revenue). The goal was to gather relevant data for analysis and insights into the largest corporations globally.

Key Steps:
Data Collection: Utilized web scraping techniques to extract data directly from the Wikipedia page, ensuring the information was up-to-date and accurate.
Data Processing: Cleaned and organized the scraped data to fit a structured format, making it suitable for further analysis.
Exporting Data: Exported the processed data to a CSV file for easy access and usability in various data analysis tools.
Technologies Used:
Python: The primary programming language used for web scraping.
Beautiful Soup and Requests: Libraries utilized to navigate and scrape the HTML content from the webpage.
Pandas: Employed for data manipulation and exporting to CSV.
Outcome:
The final output is a well-structured CSV file containing essential details about the top 50 companies, including their names, revenue figures, and other relevant attributes. This project showcases my skills in data extraction, processing, and analysis, serving as a foundation for more complex data-driven projects.
